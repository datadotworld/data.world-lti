If the installation process was successful, users of the configured course should see a “data.world” menu item within the course navigation. Upon clicking on that menu item, the user should be presented with either an authentication page prompting them to create a new account or sign in with an existing one, or if they have previously authenticated, an interface for searching and reviewing resources on the data.world platform.
